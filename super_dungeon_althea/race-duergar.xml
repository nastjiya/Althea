            <h4>CULTURE</h4>
            <p>The duergar are builders of monuments and inventors of grand machinery. When the exodus into the underdark began the duergar were ready, lending ax, shovel, and pick to dig the great subterranean pathways from the surface to their underground siblings. Unfortunately the constant backbreaking exposure to the worst of the mold has had a lasting effect on the duergar, resulting in psychic spores infesting millions of their number. Those that survived have developed certain psionic defenses against further attacks.</p>
            <h4>FAVORED BACKGROUNDS</h4>
            <p>Duergar craftsmanship is in perennial demand, leading many of their ranks to become Guild Artisans. More vindictive Duergar put their physical hardiness to work on Althea’s surface as Guild Hounds to fight the mold.</p>
            <h4>DUERGAR NAMES</h4>
            <p>Aelwig, Cwengeld, Guthilda, Trumlac, Veagar.</p>
            <p>Duergar take their surnames from a parent, usually the more well known one.</p>
            <p><i>Examples:</i> Of-Wereheath, Of-Milgifu, Of-Ranharth</p>
